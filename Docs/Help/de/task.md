# Task

A task can be created by yourself, another user or by another module as part of a workflow. Tasks (or TODOs) are used to describe what needs to be done and with which priority they should be done. In some cases other modules can also create tasks for users as part of their purpose and workflow.

## Priority & Due

Tasks can have either a priority or a due date. Both are exclusive and cannot be used in combination. In some cases it can make more sense to give something a priority if no definitive due date is known/agreed upon and in some situations a fixed due date can be used.

When sorting tasks the priorities are sorted according to the following criteria:

* Very high = same as due in 1 day
* High = same as due in 1 week
* Medium = same as due in 2 weeks
* Low = same as due in 1 month
* Very low = due after 1 month

## Visibility

Tasks are visible to:

* people/groups the task is assigned to
* people/groups mentioned in copy
* the person who created the task
* people/groups the task got forwarded to

## Editable

A task can be made editable or locked. In case a task is marked as locked, the task and created responses cannot be changed. This can be important for tasks which need to be auditable / non-changable (e.g. ISO system). A task which is defined as locked can never be made editable again, so please be careful when you choose to define a task as locked. By default tasks are editable.

## Status

The status of a task can be one of the following:

* Open = default status
* Working = working on task
* Suspended = task is on hold
* Canceled = task got canceled/aborted
* Done = task is completed
